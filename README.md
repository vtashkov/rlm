# The Rust Machine Learning library
The Rust Machine library aims to provide all kinds of machine learning algorithms to Rust ecosystems. It is in very early stage, but the goal is to be production-grade library, written entirely in Rust. The only dependancy is [ArrayFire Library](http://arrayfire.org) and that is so to allow real high-performace applications, executed on various accelerators (CPU, GPU - both CUDA and OpenCL).
